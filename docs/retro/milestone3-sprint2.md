Milestone 3 - Sprint 2: Backend pipeline, guardrails, and quick fixes

Scope
- Establish one-command backend verification (build + lint + e2e) resilient to new packages/features.
- Normalize package exports for dist resolution; composite TypeScript builds.
- Enforce architecture boundaries (features must not import API/orpc; no cross-package src imports).
- Document quick fixes and compromises for a clean handoff.

Changes
- Build graph: tooling/typescript/tsconfig.backend.json orchestrates backend packages.
- Guardrails: dependency-cruiser rules (no-cross-package-src-imports, no-feature-to-api).
- Features decoupled from API; agents-run exposes transport-agnostic commands.
- API adapters: temporary fallback routes for agents-run (POST start, POST cancel, GET stream) in packages/api/index.ts while wiring oRPC.
- Size/literal check scope: limit to backend sources, whitelist generated/large known files.
- Publint unblocked: add versions, dist exports, and root version.
- Config package: dist exports enabled for vitest/vite resolution.

Runbook
1) pnpm run build:backend
2) pnpm run backend:lint
3) pnpm run backend:e2e

Known follow-ups
- Replace fallback routes with finalized oRPC adapters once routing verified.
- Revisit mail package build (mail-dist-blocker).
- Tighten publint scope to publishable packages only in CI.
- Reduce quickfix whitelists as code is refactored.

Risk/Impact
- Minimal risk; fallback routes are additive and limited to agents-run. Guardrails prevent regressions.

Handoff Summary
- Backend build graph and guardrails are in place. `pnpm run build:backend` and `pnpm run backend:lint` pass (publint warns about ESM/CJS mixed outputs—captured for later follow-up).
- Backend e2e (`pnpm run backend:e2e`) still fails: POST `/api/agents/runs` returns 404 via `app.fetch` in the test harness. Temporary fallback routes were added in `packages/api/index.ts`, but Hono’s middleware ordering likely prevents them from running before the oRPC handler. Logs confirm the fallback is not hit.
- Current quick fixes:
  - Guardrail rules scoped to backend packages, whitelists for known large/generated files.
  - Root version set to `0.0.0` to appease publint; config package and others have dist exports.
  - Agents-run feature exports transport-agnostic commands.
- Pending issues:
  - Resolve agents-run routing: ensure POST/GET routes respond correctly (either by adjusting Hono routing order or finalizing oRPC adapters). Tests expect 200 + SSE stream.
  - Mail package remains intentionally excluded.
  - publint warnings about ESM/CJS should be triaged later.
- Suggested next steps before manual test/push:
  1. Fix routing so backend e2e passes (`packages/api/tests/agents-run.e2e.spec.ts`).
  2. Remove debug logging from API/test once green.
  3. Re-run `pnpm backend:test` (build + lint + e2e).
  4. Run `pnpm dev` and smoke the API/SSE flow manually.
  5. Tag PR with root version quick fix and doc this handoff.
- Graphiti TODOs left open:
  - `agents-run-decouple-api` (in progress): finalize route wiring.
  - `backend-size-check-scope` (in progress): revisit whitelists later.
  - `mail-dist-blocker` (pending).
