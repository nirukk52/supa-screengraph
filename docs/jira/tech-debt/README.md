## Tech Debt Template

All technical debt items follow a structured format (see `0000-template.md`):

```markdown
---
id: DEBT-XXX-NNN
title: Short Title
status: Open | In Progress | Resolved | Deferred

## Workflow

1. **Create** tech debt file in `docs/jira/tech-debt/DEBT-XXX-NNN.md`
2. **Track** status changes in frontmatter
3. **Link** to PRs and issues
4. **Update** README index when resolved
5. **Archive** (optional) to `docs/jira/tech-debt/archive/` after completion

---

## Status Definitions

- **Open**: Identified, not yet started
- **In Progress**: Actively being addressed
- **Resolved**: Completed and verified
- **Deferred**: Postponed to future milestone
- **Won't Fix**: Intentionally not addressing

## When to Create Tech Debt Items

Create a technical debt item when:
- Taking shortcuts to meet deadlines
- Identifying opportunities for refactoring
- Discovering inconsistent patterns
- Planning infrastructure improvements
- Noting deprecated dependencies
- Finding missing tests or documentation

**Note:** Tech debt is intentional. It's tracked, planned work‚Äînot bugs.

## Integration with GitHub Issues

Each tech debt item can reference a GitHub issue:
- Create issue with `tech-debt` label
- Reference issue number in tech debt file
- Link tech debt file in GitHub issue description

## Tips for Managing Tech Debt

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Document why the debt exists
- Estimate impact and effort
- Link to related code/modules
- Track metrics when possible
- Plan remediation incrementally

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Use tech debt to avoid fixing bugs
- Let debt accumulate without tracking
- Skip impact analysis
- Ignore until it becomes critical
