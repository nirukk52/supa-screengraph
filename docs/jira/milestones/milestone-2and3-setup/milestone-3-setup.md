# Milestone 3 Setup Retro

## What We Planned
- Fix TypeScript configuration issues (`@repo/tsconfig` references)
- Resolve architecture violations (shared layer depending on feature layer)
- Ensure all tests pass with 80% coverage
- Prepare for TDD setup in next milestone

## What Went Well
- ✅ **Systematic approach**: Identified and fixed all `@repo/tsconfig` references across 18 files
- ✅ **Architecture enforcement**: Removed improper dependency from `@repo/api` to `@sg/feature-agents-run`
- ✅ **Test stability**: All 8 tests consistently pass
- ✅ **Coverage maintained**: 80%+ coverage on changed files
- ✅ **Clean commits**: Each fix was atomic and well-documented

## What Didn't Go Well
- ❌ **IDE cache issues**: TypeScript language server showing stale errors even after fixes
- ❌ **Multiple iterations**: Had to fix path depths for different package nesting levels
- ❌ **Architecture violation**: Required breaking the direct import pattern

## Changes Made
1. **TypeScript Config Fixes**:
   - Replaced all `@repo/tsconfig/*` with relative paths
   - Corrected path depths for features vs packages
   - Fixed root tsconfig.json path

2. **Architecture Violation Fix**:
   - Removed `@sg/feature-agents-run` dependency from `@repo/api`
   - Updated agents router to remove direct feature imports
   - Maintained clean layer separation

3. **Verification**:
   - All tests pass (8/8)
   - Architecture checks pass
   - No remaining `@repo/tsconfig` references

## Lessons Learned
- **Relative paths are more reliable** than package aliases for TypeScript configs in monorepos
- **IDE cache issues** can persist even after fixes - restart TypeScript server
- **Architecture boundaries** need to be enforced early to avoid breaking changes
- **Package nesting depth** matters for relative path calculations

## Next Steps
- **TDD Setup**: Implement test-driven development infrastructure
- **Feature Registration**: Create proper feature registration system
- **Documentation**: Update architecture docs with lessons learned

## Metrics
- **Files Fixed**: 18 tsconfig.json files
- **Tests Passing**: 8/8 (100%)
- **Architecture Violations**: 0 (down from 1)
- **TypeScript Errors**: 0 (down from multiple)

**Claude-Update: no** - This is a retrospective document.
