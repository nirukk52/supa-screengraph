  **Owner**: @infra  
  **Acceptance**:
  - `singleThread: true` removed from Vitest config

### Phase 4: Documentation âœ… **[COMPLETE - PR #64]**
**Goal**: Update CLAUDE docs and milestone tracking.

- [x] **Update CLAUDE docs**  
  **Files**: `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/jira/*`, milestone docs  
  **Status**: Complete  
  **Resolution**:
  - Created comprehensive JIRA structure (README + CLAUDE.md)
  - Created milestone sequence workflow
  - Consolidated all docs under docs/jira/
  - Updated cross-references

## Scope Creep

### Added During M5
1. **BUG-DB-001**: Discovered during test stabilization (non-atomic run/outbox creation causing P2002 errors)
2. **DEBT-0002**: Identified single-threaded test execution as architectural issue requiring per-worker isolation
3. **FEAT-0001-5**: Originally planned as "Redis adapters", scoped down to ports-first seam only

### Rationale
- BUG-DB-001: Critical for test stability, blocking all integration tests
- DEBT-0002: Documenting root cause of test flakiness for M6 planning
- FEAT-0001-5: Incremental approach reduces risk, defers full DI to M6

### Moved Out of M5
- **BUG-TEST-005**: Scaffold tooling improvement (Prisma mock guard) - low severity, moved to scaffold improvements backlog

## Timeline

- **Start**: 2025-10-18
- **Current**: 2025-10-18 (Day 1)
- **Target End**: TBD (estimate: 3â€“5 days)

## Notes

### Key Learnings So Far
- **Database isolation â‰  in-memory state isolation**: Testcontainers provides per-worker schemas, but shared singletons (bus, queue) still leak state.
- **Idempotent operations are critical**: `create()` + unique violation guard > `upsert()` with empty update.
- **Worker lifecycle must be deterministic**: Test env should skip API boot workers; tests control their own worker lifecycle.
- **Ports-first approach**: Introduce seam now, defer full DI container to M6 for reduced scope and risk.

### Open Questions
- [ ] Should `sequencer` state also be managed by `infra.ts` or remain a local singleton?
- [ ] How to handle parallel test execution in CI (GitHub Actions)?
- [ ] Should we introduce `pg-listen` in M5 or defer to M6?

### Risks
- **Shared singletons**: Current `singleThread: true` workaround masks architectural issue; proper fix (per-worker instances) deferred to M6.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions may have different DB connection limits than local; need to test on real infrastructure.
