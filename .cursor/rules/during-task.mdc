This rule describes DURING_TASK behavior while implementing changes.

- Respect discovered Preferences and follow Procedures exactly.
- Apply relevant Facts; stay consistent with existing knowledge.
- Capture new requirements immediately via Graphiti episodes.
- Enforce size limits: file ≤ 150 lines; function ≤ 50 lines; diff ≤ 1000 additions.
- Validate external input and normalize unknowns; no implicit any; no mutation of shared state.
