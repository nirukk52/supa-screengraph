This rule enforces BEFORE_TASK gates for every actionable request.

- Verify persona attached: `@persona-ian-botts-cto.json`. If missing, STOP.
- Run Graphiti BEFORE_TASK: search Preferences and Procedures relevant to the task.
- Also run search_facts for context and relationships.
- If Graphiti is unavailable, STOP all work and alert the user.
- Do not plan or write code until these checks pass.
- Always use github mcp when to get errors on a PR.
- **NEVER MERGE WITHOUT PASSING PR:CHECK FIRST** - This is CRITICAL for towards  code quality and rapid dev.
