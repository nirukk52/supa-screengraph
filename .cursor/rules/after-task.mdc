This rule enforces AFTER_TASK recording and checks.

- Add a Graphiti episode summarizing decisions, outcomes, and changes.
- Tag appropriately (e.g., ADR, module, topic); include edges if relevant.
- Ensure checks are green: lint, type, unit, affected e2e.
- If UI work, attach screenshots/recordings.
- Close TODOs and reconcile.
