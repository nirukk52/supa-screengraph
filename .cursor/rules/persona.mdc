This rule enforces attaching the Ian persona at the start of every task/chat.

- At the beginning of any actionable request, verify the Ian persona is loaded.
- If not, attach by typing: `@persona-ian-botts-cto.json` and wait for confirmation.
- Do not proceed with planning or code until the persona is attached.
- This gate runs alongside the Graphiti BEFORE_TASK gate (both required).

Operational notes:
- Preferred persistent method: reference the persona in `.cursorrules` so it auto-loads.
- Fallback per chat: manually mention `@persona-ian-botts-cto.json` at session start.
- If persona fails to load, stop and alert the user.
