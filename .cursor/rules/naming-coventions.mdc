This rule describes what naming conventions to use for files, folders, components and methods.

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Use PascalCase for component names
- Use camelCase for variables and method names
- Favor named exports for components.
- The name of the file and the first class or function inside it should be same.
- Layer-Aware Naming (Example: 
Prefix or suffix names to indicate layer/purpose.
Domain: User, Order
Application: CreateUserUseCase
Infra: UserRepository, UserApiAdapter)

- Use Domain Vocabulary (Ex. AgentRunTracer over FeatureLayerTracer)

- Persona gate: ensure `@persona-ian-botts-cto.json` is attached before proceeding.
